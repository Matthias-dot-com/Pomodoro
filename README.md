# **Pomodoro Timer using Tkinter**

The Pomodoro technique is an efficient system of time management.

where instead of multitasking, a person focuses on a particular task at a given moment.

The idea is to work for 25 straight minutes (a single Pomodoro) and then take a 5-minute break.
After completing 4 Pomodoros, the user takes a longer break of 20 minutes.
